    Our goal is to teach 10,000 students how to code by the year 2020. There
    are 100,000 young people that currently don't have access to computer
    science courses in the Bay Area. That's 100,000 reasons we need your
    support. Every little bit counts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mission Bit courses are project-based semester-long coding courses, taught
    by college computer science majors and supported by volunteers who are
    professional software engineers. Mission Bit education experiences are
    all-inclusive and ethnically and gender diverse. Mission Bit’s
    complementary programs create pathways for "limited access" students to
    form connections with technology professionals and learn the skills,
    processes, and technologies used by professional programmers.
